**To build:**
```build.sh ```

**To clean:**
```clean.sh ```

**To run:**
```run.sh <number of daemons> <coordinator mode> ```

```<number of daemons> ``` is a number between 1 and the maximum number set in the config.cfg.

```<coordinator mode> ``` is either fixed or auto, where fixed makes the first daemon coordinator, and auto attempts to choose the best coordinator.

local_run.sh can also be used, communicates over loopback

```gui.sh ``` to open a graphical interface
