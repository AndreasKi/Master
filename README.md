# Master
To run:

```run.sh <number of daemons> <coordinator mode```

```number of daemons``` is a number between 1 and the maximum number set in the config.cfg.

```<coordinator mode>``` is either fixed or auto, where fixed makes the first daemon coordinator, and auto attempts to choose the best coordinator.
