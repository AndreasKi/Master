The sinner when he rose was like one who falls, and does not know how
through the power of a demon that drags him down to the ground, or through some other affliction that binds men,
and, when he rises, gazes round himself, all dazed by the great anguish he has suffered, and as he gazes, sighs.
O how heavy the power of God, that showers down such blows in vengeance!
